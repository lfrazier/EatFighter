Eat Fighter II
==========

'Eat Fighter II' is a game that pits you against nearby restaurants. Square off against lower rated restaurants to get to the better rated ones. Fight your way to the top to get the best lunch!

##In-game instructions:
New Game: Fight your way up through the ladder. If you want to eat at a restaurant, you must defeat it first. If you lose, you must eat lunch at the last restaurant that you defeated. If you beat them all, you win the game (and can eat at the best restaurant)!
Move using the joystick on the left, and punch with the 'P' button on the right.

Write Review: Write reviews and give star ratings for restuarants. Remove a restaurant from the table to never see it again. Remember, star ratings impact the order that you will face the restaurants (lowest-rated to highest-rated).

##Notes
###General
The majority of the app was written in 3 days. The concept behind it came from the idea that playing the game should somehow earn you the right to eat better and better lunches.
The "Write Reviews" screen incorporates keeping track of restaurants, writing reviews, rating restaurants (0-5 stars), and deleting a restaurant permanently.
The restaurant list is stored on the phone. The restaurant reviews are displayed during the game, before each match. Finally, Twitter is incorporated after the player has won/lost the game.

###Things I Am Particularly Proud Of
* Idling, moving, and punching animations for protagonist/enemy
* In order to differentiate your character from the enemy, I randomly assigned a tint to the enemy sprites.
* Also, the sound effects for the user landing a punch differ slightly from the sound of an enemy restaurant landing a punch.
* I felt that I was able to give the game a polished, high-quality feel in only several days.

###Things I Would Add If I Had More Time
* Ability for enemy to move
* Better AI all around
* Jump, Kick, and Combo attacks
* Use user's location to find restaurants, rather than hardcoding them in
