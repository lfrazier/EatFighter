Eat Fighter II
==========

'Eat Fighter II' is a game that pits you against nearby restaurants. Square off against lower rated restaurants to get to the better rated ones. Fight your way to the top to get the best lunch!

###In-game instructions:
New Game: Fight your way up through the ladder. If you want to eat at a restaurant, you must defeat it first. If you lose, you must eat lunch at the last restaurant that you defeated. If you beat them all, you win the game (and can eat at the best restaurant)!
Move using the joystick on the left, and punch with the 'P' button on the right.

Write Review: Write reviews and give star ratings for restuarants. Remove a restaurant from the table to never see it again. Remember, star ratings impact the order that you will face the restaurants (lowest-rated to highest-rated).
